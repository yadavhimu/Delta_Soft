          To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we

          What personal data we collect and why we collect it
        </p>
        <p>
          In this section you should note what personal data you collect from
          users and site visitors. This may include personal data, such as name,
          email address, personal account preferences; transactional data, such
          as purchase information; and technical data, such as information about
          cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should also note any collection and retention of sensitive
          personal data, such as data concerning health.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to listing what personal data you collect, you need to
          note why you collect it. These explanations must note either the legal
          basis for your data collection and retention or the active consent the
          user has given.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal data is not just created by a user’s interactions with your
          site. Personal data is also generated from technical processes such as
          contact forms, comments, cookies, analytics, and third party embeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default WordPress does not collect any personal data about
          visitors, and only collects the data shown on the User Profile screen
          from registered users. However some of your plugins may collect
          personal data. You should add the relevant information below.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl font-medium">Comments</p>
        <p>
          In this subsection you should note what information is captured
          through comments. We have noted the data which WordPress collects by
          default. Suggested text:When visitors leave comments on the site we
          collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP
          address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
        </p>
        <p>
          An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a
          hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using
          it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here:

        <p className="text-xl font-medium">Media</p>

        <p>
          In this subsection you should note what information may be disclosed
          by users who can upload media files. All uploaded files are usually
          publicly accessible. Suggested text:If you upload images to the
          website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data
          (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract
          any location data from images on the website.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl font-medium">Contact forms</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          By default, WordPress does not include a contact form. If you use a
          contact form plugin, use this subsection to note what personal data is
          captured when someone submits a contact form, and how long you keep
          it. For example, you may note that you keep contact form submissions
          for a certain period for customer service purposes, but you do not use
          the information submitted through them for marketing purposes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl font-medium">Cookies</p>
        <p>
          In this subsection you should list the cookies your web site uses,
          including those set by your plugins, social media, and analytics. We
          have provided the cookies which WordPress installs by default.

          Suggested text:Articles on this site may include embedded content
          (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other
          websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited
          the other website.
        </p>
        <p>
          These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed
          additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with
          that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the
          embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that
          website.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl font-medium">Analytics</p>
        <p>
          In this subsection you should note what analytics package you use, how
          users can opt out of analytics tracking, and a link to your analytics
          provider’s privacy policy, if any. By default WordPress does not
          collect any analytics data. However, many web hosting accounts collect
          some anonymous analytics data. You may also have installed a WordPress
          plugin that provides analytics services. In that case, add information
          from that plugin here.

          Who we share your data with

          In this section you should name and list all third party providers
          with whom you share site data, including partners, cloud-based
          services, payment processors, and third party service providers, and
          note what data you share with them and why. Link to their own privacy
          policies if possible. By default WordPress does not share any personal
          data with anyone.

          How long we retain your data
        </p>
        <p>
          In this section you should explain how long you retain personal data
          collected or processed by the web site. While it is your
          responsibility to come up with the schedule of how long you keep each
          data set for and why you keep it, that information does need to be
          listed here. For example, you may want to say that you keep contact
          form entries for six months, analytics records for a year, and
          customer purchase records for ten years. Suggested text:If you leave a
          comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This
          is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments
          automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue. For users
          that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal
          information they provide in their user profile. All users can see,
          edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they
          cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and

          What rights you have over your data

        <p>
          In this section you should explain what rights your users have over
          their data and how they can invoke those rights. Suggested text:If you
          have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request
          to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you,
          including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that

          In this section you should list all transfers of your site data
          outside the European Union and describe the means by which that data
          is safeguarded to European data protection standards. This could
          include your web hosting, cloud storage, or other third party
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          European data protection law requires data about European residents
          which is transferred outside the European Union to be safeguarded to
          the same standards as if the data was in Europe. So in addition to
          listing where data goes, you should describe how you ensure that these
          standards are met either by yourself or by your third party providers,
          whether that is through an agreement such as Privacy Shield, model
          clauses in your contracts, or binding corporate rules.

          This sample language includes the basics around what personal data

          which additional plugins are used, the specific information shared by
          your store will vary. We recommend consulting with a lawyer when
          deciding what information to disclose on your privacy policy.

          If you create an account, we will store your name, address, email and
