              Earlier SaaS was the key model that companies adopted,
               but that is no longer the case considering increased
               costs, limited customizations and vague data ownership
               terms. Moreover, as business workflows become more
               elaborate, custom software that can solve business
               needs without having to work around the limitations of
              off-the-shelf software become necessary.
