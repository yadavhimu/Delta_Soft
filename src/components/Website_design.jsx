          website displays various content types every time it is browsed. The

          static site is one that is usually written in <br /> plain HTML and
          what is in the code of the page is what is displayed to the user. A
          dynamic site is one that is
          <br /> written using a server-side scripting language such as PHP,
          ASP, JSP, or Coldfusion.
